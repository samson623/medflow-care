# Development agents (optional)

These are **optional development prompts** used during authoring and code review. They are **not part of the shipped product**. The MedFlow Care application does not include any "agent system," orchestrator, or specialist runtime.

For details and prompt index, see the `.agent/` directory in this repo. Use them only as development workflow aids.
